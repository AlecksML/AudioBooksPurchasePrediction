# Description:
The goal of this project is to Create a Machine Learning algorithm that will be able to predict if a customer will buy again.

# Context:

Each customer appearing in the audiobooks database data has made a purchase at least once. If a customer is less likely to buy again from the store, it is not logical to spend resources advertising to them. So, the company will focus on only customers who are likely to buy again, and this will increase the sales.

# Content:
Data is collected from an audiobook app and specifically relating to only audio books bought from the store.
the dataset consist of following columns:

CustomerID, Sum Book_length, avg Book_length, Sum Price, avg price, Review, Review(out of 10), Minutes listened, Completion, Support Requests, Last visited minus purchase date, Purchase(targets).
